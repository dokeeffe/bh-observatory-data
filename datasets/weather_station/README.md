This weather data is from a home made weather station which monitors rain, sky temperature (IR) and ambient temperature.

Readings are taken every minute (unless a major change in conditions then sooner)

Readings look like this:

```

     {
         "skyTemp" : -7.35,
         "rain" : false,
         "readingTimestamp" : "2019-04-08 03:15:58",
         "outsideTemp" : 9.27
      },

```
